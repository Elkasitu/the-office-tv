#The Office TV
--------------
I made this flask application to stream episodes of The Office that I have on my home PC to my TV, smartphone, tablet, etc.

## The future
-------------
I am currently working on implementing an actual way to search/display videos in an organized manner instead of just displaying them in the order that the walk function
delivers them.

After that, a basic/modest UI using CSS and maybe some javascript is in order.

In the near future, I'd like to add the option for "TV mode" which would basically play video files from the static folder (or whatever folder you like if you 
use an actual web server for static file serving) in a random or pseudo-random order (I'd try to avoid replaying the same episode for an arbitrary amount 
of time/episodes).

As for long-term goals, nothing yet since the main purpose of this project is to learn some Flask and of course to watch some The Office episodes from the couch, 
bed or even from the dining table.
